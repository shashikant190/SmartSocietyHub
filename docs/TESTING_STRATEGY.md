# Testing Strategy

## Purpose

This document defines the testing architecture and quality assurance strategy for Smart Society.

It standardizes:

- testing priorities
- testing types
- workflow validation
- QA responsibilities
- regression prevention

This file acts as the testing source of truth for:

- AI agents
- reviewers
- maintainers

---

# Testing Philosophy

The goal of testing is NOT:

```txt
100% coverage vanity metrics
```

The goal IS:

```txt
protect critical workflows and prevent regressions
```

---

# Current Reality

The repository currently appears:

- prototype-oriented
- rapidly evolving
- partially incomplete

This creates high regression risk during:

- refactors
- AI-agent parallel development
- schema changes
- permission updates

---

# Highest Testing Priority Areas

## Critical Systems

| Area | Priority |
|---|---|
| Authentication | CRITICAL |
| Permissions/RBAC | CRITICAL |
| Billing & Payments | CRITICAL |
| Visitor Security | HIGH |
| Complaint Lifecycle | HIGH |
| Resident Ownership Access | HIGH |

---

# Testing Pyramid Strategy

Recommended testing balance:

```txt
Unit Tests
 ↓
Integration Tests
 ↓
End-to-End Workflow Tests
```

---

# Recommended Testing Stack

| Purpose | Recommended Tool |
|---|---|
| Unit/Integration | Vitest |
| React Testing | Testing Library |
| E2E | Playwright |
| API Testing | Vitest/Supertest |
| Mocking | MSW |

---

# Test Categories

# 1. Unit Tests

## Purpose

Validate isolated logic.

---

# Recommended Targets

Test:

- utility functions
- validation schemas
- permission helpers
- formatting helpers
- calculations

---

# Example

```ts
calculateLateFee()
hasPermission()
formatCurrency()
```

---

# Important Rule

Do NOT over-test:

- trivial UI rendering
- framework behavior

---

# 2. Integration Tests

## Purpose

Validate:

- API behavior
- service workflows
- database interactions

---

# Highest Priority Integration Areas

## Authentication

Test:

- login
- logout
- session handling
- unauthorized access

---

## RBAC

Test:

- role permissions
- ownership validation
- restricted access

---

## Billing

Test:

- bill generation
- payment recording
- transaction consistency

---

## Complaint Workflow

Test:

- creation
- assignment
- resolution
- escalation

---

# 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

## Purpose

Validate real user workflows.

---

# Recommended E2E Workflows

## Resident Workflow

```txt
Login
 ↓
View Dashboard
 ↓
Create Complaint
 ↓
Track Status
```

---

## Visitor Workflow

```txt
Visitor Request
 ↓
Resident Approval
 ↓
Guard Verification
 ↓
Entry Logging
```

---

## Billing Workflow

```txt
Generate Bill
 ↓
Resident Payment
 ↓
Receipt Confirmation
```

---

# 4. Security Tests

## Purpose

Prevent:

- permission bypasses
- unauthorized access
- sensitive data exposure

---

# Critical Security Test Areas

## RBAC

Ensure:

- residents cannot access admin APIs
- security cannot access financial data
- tenants cannot modify ownership data

---

## Ownership Validation

Ensure users can ONLY access:

- own complaints
- own bills
- own visitors

---

## Session Security

Validate:

- logout invalidation
- protected route blocking
- expired sessions

---

# 5. API Tests

## Purpose

Ensure API consistency.

---

# Every API Must Validate

- request body
- params
- query values
- permissions
- standardized responses

---

# Required API Test Areas

## Success Cases

Validate:

- proper responses
- correct status codes

---

## Failure Cases

Validate:

- invalid input handling
- permission rejection
- missing resources

---

# Standard Response Validation

Every API should return:

## Success

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

---

## Error

```json
{
  "success": false
}
```

---

# 6. UI/UX Tests

## Purpose

Validate:

- usability
- rendering
- accessibility
- interaction flows

---

# Important UI Areas

## Forms

Validate:

- validation feedback
- loading states
- disabled submits

---

## Tables

Validate:

- pagination
- filtering
- sorting

---

## Mobile Layouts

Validate:

- responsiveness
- touch usability

---

# 7. Accessibility Testing

## Required Areas

Validate:

- keyboard navigation
- semantic HTML
- labels
- contrast

---

# Accessibility Is Mandatory

Accessibility is NOT optional.

---

# Regression Testing

# Purpose

Prevent existing workflows from breaking during:

- refactors
- AI-agent changes
- schema updates

---

# Critical Regression Areas

## Must Always Work

- authentication
- billing
- visitor approvals
- complaints
- notices

---

# Test Environment Strategy

# Recommended Environments

| Environment | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Development | active coding |
| Staging | QA validation |
| Production | live deployment |

---

# Database Testing Strategy

# Recommended Test Database

Use:

```txt
isolated test database
```

Never test against:

```txt
production data
```

---

# Mocking Strategy

# Good Mock Candidates

Mock:

- external APIs
- notification systems
- payment providers

---

# Avoid Excessive Mocking

Critical workflows should test:

- real services
- real validation
- real permissions

---

# Financial Testing Requirements

## Critical Rules

Billing systems require:

- transaction testing
- reconciliation testing
- duplicate payment prevention

---

# Required Financial Test Cases

- double payment attempts
- failed transaction recovery
- incorrect bill calculations

---

# Visitor Security Testing

## Critical Areas

Validate:

- unauthorized approvals
- blacklist enforcement
- duplicate entries

---

# Logging Verification

Critical operations should verify:

- audit logs created
- sensitive actions tracked

---

# Performance Testing (Future)

Potential future testing:

- dashboard load performance
- API stress testing
- large dataset pagination

---

# AI-Agent Testing Rules

## All AI Agents MUST

### Add Tests For Critical Logic

Especially:

- auth
- permissions
- billing
- workflows

---

### Avoid Breaking Existing Flows

Regression testing required.

---

### Respect API Contracts

Tests should validate contract consistency.

---

# Reviewer Agent Responsibilities

Reviewer agent should validate:

- missing test coverage
- broken workflows
- permission edge cases

---

# CI/CD Testing Rules

Every pull request should run:

- lint
- type checks
- tests

---

# Required CI Gates

A PR should NOT merge if:

- tests fail
- type errors exist
- permission checks break

---

# Recommended Testing Priorities

# Phase 1

- auth tests
- RBAC tests
- validation tests

---

# Phase 2

- billing tests
- complaint workflow tests
- visitor workflow tests

---

# Phase 3

- UI/UX tests
- accessibility tests
- E2E flows

---

# Coverage Philosophy

Aim for:

```txt
high-value coverage
```

NOT:

```txt
artificial coverage percentages
```

---

# Final Testing Philosophy

The testing system should become:

```txt
Reliable
Focused
Security-Aware
Regression-Resistant
```

The most important thing to protect is:

```txt
critical operational workflows
```

NOT:

```txt
unnecessary test quantity
```
