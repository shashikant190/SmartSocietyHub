# Role & Permission System

## Purpose

This document defines the authorization architecture for Smart Society.

It standardizes:

- user roles
- permissions
- access scopes
- protected operations
- module access rules

This system must become the single source of truth for authorization.

---

# Core Security Principle

Authentication answers:

```txt
Who are you?
```

Authorization answers:

```txt
What are you allowed to do?
```

Both are mandatory.

---

# Important Security Rule

Frontend role checks are NOT security.

All permissions must be enforced:

- server-side
- API-side
- middleware-side

Never trust the client.

# Permission Design Philosophy

Avoid:

```txt
role === ADMIN
```

Instead use:

```txt
permissions
```

---

CAN_CREATE_NOTICE
CAN_APPROVE_VISITOR
CAN_MANAGE_BILLING
CAN_VIEW_FINANCIAL_REPORTS

# Role Permission Mapping

# SUPER_ADMIN

Access:

```txt
ALL PERMISSIONS
```

---

# ADMIN

Typical permissions:

- resident management
- complaints
- visitors
- finances
- notices
- reports

Restrictions:

- infrastructure-level controls

---

# SECRETARY

Typical permissions:

- notices
- events

---

# TREASURER

---

# SECURITY

---

# Ownership-Based Authorization

## Critical Rule

Roles alone are NOT enough.

Example:
A resident should only access:

```txt
their own complaints
their own bills
their own visitors
```

---

# Required Ownership Checks

Validate:

- resource ownership
- flat ownership
- assigned permissions
- society isolation

---

# API Authorization Rules

Every protected API must validate:

## 1. Authentication

Example:

```txt
Is user logged in?
```

---

## 2. Role Permission

Example:

```txt
Can this role perform this action?
```

---

## 3. Ownership Access

Example:

```txt
Does this complaint belong to the resident?
```

---

# Middleware Strategy

# Required Middleware

## Auth Middleware

Checks:

- session
- authentication

---

## Permission Middleware

Checks:

- permissions
- role access

---

## Ownership Middleware

Checks:

- entity ownership
- society access scope

---

# Recommended Permission Utilities

# Example

```ts
hasPermission(user, "CAN_CREATE_NOTICE")
```

---

# Avoid

```ts
if (user.role === "ADMIN")
```

throughout the codebase.

Centralize permission checks.

---

# Frontend Permission Strategy

Frontend checks are ONLY for:

- UX visibility
- conditional rendering

Example:

- hide admin buttons

---

# Important Rule

Frontend checks DO NOT replace:

- backend validation
- API authorization

---

# Database-Level Considerations

Sensitive entities:

- payments
- resident data
- security logs
- visitor history

must always validate:

- role
- ownership
- society access

---

# Audit Logging Requirements

Critical permission-sensitive actions must log:

- user
- action
- timestamp
- target entity

Examples:

- bill generation
- visitor approvals
- resident deletion
- complaint closure

---

# Permission Escalation Risks

High-risk operations:

- changing roles
- modifying payments
- deleting residents
- approving blacklisted visitors

Require:

- strict validation
- audit logs

---

# Recommended Future Enhancements

## Granular Permissions

Future support:

```txt
module-level permissions
feature flags
temporary access grants
```

---

## Multi-Society Isolation

Future SaaS support should isolate:

```txt
society-specific permissions
```

---

# Forbidden Authorization Practices

## AI Agents MUST NEVER

### Trust Frontend Permissions

Never.

---

### Hardcode Roles Everywhere

Use centralized permission utilities.

---

### Skip Ownership Validation

Critical security risk.

---

### Expose Sensitive APIs

All sensitive APIs require authorization.

---

# Testing Requirements

Permission testing is REQUIRED for:

- admin routes
- billing operations
- resident ownership access
- visitor approvals
- complaint management

---

# Final Authorization Philosophy

The authorization system must become:

```txt
Centralized
Predictable
Auditable
Secure
Scalable
```

The entire application security depends on:

- permission consistency
- ownership validation
- server-side enforcement
