# Smart Society — Project Overview

## Project Summary

Smart Society is a modern society/apartment management platform designed for residential communities and housing societies.

The application aims to centralize all society operations into a single dashboard-driven system for residents, administrators, security guards, and management committee members.

The current repository is an incomplete but strong demo foundation containing:

- dashboard architecture
- Prisma database schema
- API routes
- authentication setup
- multiple management modules
- mobile support integration
- role-based structure

The project is currently in transition from:

- demo/prototype stage
  to
- production-ready scalable platform

---

## Backend

- Next.js API routes
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL

---

## Authentication

---

# Current Project Status

The repository already contains:

- multiple dashboard routes
- Prisma schema
- API structure
- component architecture
- module separation

However, many areas are still:

- partially implemented
- mock-data driven
- inconsistent
- lacking production validation
- lacking permission hardening
- missing complete workflows

This repository should currently be treated as:

- an advanced prototype
  NOT
- a production-ready application

---

# Development Vision

The final system should become:

- scalable
- modular
- secure
- mobile-friendly
- AI-agent maintainable
- production deployable

The architecture should support:

- multiple parallel AI agents
- clean module ownership
- isolated feature development
- strict API contracts
- reusable components
- scalable database design

---

# Important Development Principles

## No Demo Logic in Production

Hardcoded data and mock flows must be removed progressively.

---

## Strict Role-Based Permissions

Every route, API, and action must validate permissions server-side.

---

## Modular Architecture

Each feature should evolve independently without breaking unrelated modules.

---

## AI-Agent Friendly Development

The codebase must remain:

- predictable
- documented
- standardized
- easy to analyze automatically

---

# Current Priorities

Highest priority modules:

1. Authentication
2. Role permissions
3. Resident management
4. Maintenance billing
5. Complaint system
6. Visitor management
7. Security workflows

---

# Long-Term Goals

Potential future expansion:

- multi-society SaaS
- native mobile apps
- analytics dashboard
- smart device integration
- AI-assisted management
- automated billing/reminders
- digital society ERP ecosystem
