# Current Project Status

## Repository State

The current Smart Society repository is an advanced demo/prototype application with a partially production-ready foundation.

The project already includes:

- large-scale feature planning
- modular dashboard structure
- Prisma schema
- API routes
- authentication setup
- mobile support
- multiple management domains

However, the application is NOT production ready yet.

Many modules still contain:

- demo implementations
- incomplete workflows
- placeholder logic
- mock data
- inconsistent architecture
- missing validation/security

---

## Database Foundation

Status: STRONG

The Prisma schema is one of the strongest areas of the project.

# Architecture Issues Detected

## Mixed Demo + Production Patterns

Current repository likely mixes:

- mock data
- real APIs
- temporary state
- unfinished production logic

This is dangerous for AI agents because:

- agents may treat fake logic as real architecture
- inconsistent patterns spread quickly
- refactors become difficult

Priority:
HIGH

---

## Missing Service Layer

Current architecture appears route-centric.

Likely pattern:

```txt
API Route -> Prisma Query
```

Recommended production pattern:

```txt
API Route
   ↓
Validation Layer
   ↓
Service Layer
   ↓
Repository Layer
   ↓
Database
```

Priority:
HIGH

---

## Inconsistent Validation

Likely missing:

- zod schemas
- API validation
- form validation
- request sanitization

Priority:
HIGH

---

## Role Permission Risk

Current application appears role-aware but may not be fully role-secure.

Possible issues:

- client-side checks only
- inconsistent middleware
- API access bypass risk

Priority:
CRITICAL

---

# Mock/Demo Logic Audit Required

The entire project must be audited for:

## Mock Data

Examples:

- hardcoded dashboards
- fake metrics
- static notifications
- temporary arrays

---

## Placeholder APIs

Examples:

- dummy success responses
- incomplete CRUD
- local-only state

---

## UI-Only Features

Examples:

- buttons without backend
- incomplete forms
- missing workflows

---

# Repository Cleanup Required

Current repository contains development/debug artifacts.

Examples:

- temporary scripts
- log/error files
- migration helpers
- build outputs

These should be:

- cleaned
- isolated
- removed from production branches

Priority:
MEDIUM

---

# Current Risk Areas

## High Risk

- authentication
- authorization
- financial workflows
- billing accuracy
- visitor approval security

---

## Medium Risk

- analytics consistency
- realtime updates
- dashboard accuracy
- notification system

---

## Low Risk

- UI polish
- responsiveness
- visual consistency

---

# Immediate Refactor Priorities

## Phase 1 — Stabilization

Required before parallel AI development:

1. clean architecture
2. remove dead/demo code
3. standardize folder structure
4. centralize shared utilities
5. define module ownership

---

## Phase 2 — Security Hardening

1. RBAC
2. middleware
3. permission validation
4. protected APIs
5. session validation

---

## Phase 3 — Core Workflow Completion

Highest priority production workflows:

1. login/auth
2. resident management
3. complaint lifecycle
4. maintenance billing
5. visitor approval
6. notice distribution

---

# AI-Agent Development Warning

AI agents should NOT:

- assume demo logic is final
- reuse mock patterns
- create duplicate architecture
- directly access Prisma everywhere
- bypass permission checks

All AI agents must follow:

- standardized API contracts
- centralized validations
- modular ownership boundaries

---

# Overall Assessment

## Strengths

- ambitious feature scope
- strong Prisma schema
- modular dashboard direction
- scalable potential
- good tech stack

---

## Weaknesses

- incomplete production architecture
- mixed implementation quality
- missing standardization
- security hardening needed
- validation gaps

---

# Final Assessment

Current state:

```txt
Advanced Prototype / Pre-Production System
```

NOT:

```txt
Production Ready SaaS
```

The repository is in a very strong position for AI-assisted scaling IF:

- architecture is stabilized first
- strict development standards are enforced
- AI agents are coordinated properly
- demo logic is systematically removed
