# Priority Refactor Targets

## Purpose

This document identifies the highest-priority architectural and implementation refactors required before Smart Society can safely scale into a production-grade platform.

This file helps:

- AI agents
- maintainers
- reviewers

focus on the most important technical improvements first.

---

# Core Refactor Philosophy

The goal is NOT:

```txt
add more features quickly
```

The goal IS:

```txt
stabilize the foundation before scaling
```

A weak foundation amplified by AI agents creates:

- duplicated logic
- security gaps
- unstable architecture
- long-term maintenance problems

---

# Refactor Priority Levels

| Priority | Meaning |
|---|---|
| CRITICAL | Must be fixed immediately |
| HIGH | Required before scaling |
| MEDIUM | Important for production quality |
| LOW | Nice-to-have improvements |

---

# 1. Centralized RBAC System

## Priority

```txt
CRITICAL
```

---

# Current Problem

Authorization logic is likely:

- scattered
- inconsistent
- role-string based
- partially frontend-dependent

Example of risky pattern:

```ts
if (user.role === "ADMIN")
```

repeated throughout the codebase.

---

# Why This Is Dangerous

Risks:

- permission bypass
- inconsistent access control
- difficult auditing
- security vulnerabilities

---

# Required Refactor

Implement centralized:

- roles
- permissions
- permission utilities
- middleware
- ownership validation

---

# Target Architecture

```txt
User
 ↓
Role
 ↓
Permissions
 ↓
Protected Actions
```

---

# Required Deliverables

- centralized permission constants
- permission helper utilities
- route guards
- API authorization middleware
- ownership validation layer

---

# 2. Validation Layer Standardization

## Priority

```txt
CRITICAL
```

---

# Current Problem

Validation likely inconsistent across:

---

# Required Refactor

Adopt:

```txt
zod
```

for ALL validation.

---

# Validation Areas

Every endpoint must validate:

- body

- auth state

---

# Target Architecture

```txt
Request
 ↓
Validation
 ↓
Business Logic
```

---

# Required Refactor

Introduce:

```txt
/services

# Final Refactor Philosophy

The repository already has:

```txt

```

The main challenge now is:

```txt
architectural discipline
```

```

The most important improvements are:

```txt
stability
security
consistency
maintainability
```
