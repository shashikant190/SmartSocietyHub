# Recommended Next Steps

## Purpose

This document defines the immediate execution plan for the Smart Society repository after the initial project analysis.

It helps:

- prioritize work
- avoid architectural chaos
- coordinate AI agents correctly
- prevent premature feature expansion

This should be treated as the operational starting point for development.

---

# Current Situation

The repository already has:

- strong feature ambition
- extensive Prisma schema
- scalable module direction
- dashboard architecture
- modern tech stack

However, it still contains:

- prototype patterns
- incomplete workflows
- mixed demo logic
- inconsistent architecture
- security risks

The project is currently:

```txt
Advanced Prototype / Pre-Production System
```

---

# Most Important Principle

DO NOT:

```txt
immediately start generating massive features with AI agents
```

FIRST:

```txt
stabilize the architecture
```

This is the most important decision for long-term success.

---

# Immediate Development Priorities

# Priority 1 — Architecture Stabilization

## Goal

Prepare the repository for safe AI-agent scaling.

---

# Immediate Tasks

## Repository Cleanup

Remove:

- debug artifacts
- unused files
- temporary scripts
- experimental outputs

Examples:

```txt
tmp/
*.log
debug files
```

---

## Standardize Folder Structure

Create:

```txt
/shared/
/services/
/repositories/
/validations/
```

---

## Standardize Naming

Normalize:

- folders
- components
- hooks
- services
- utilities

---

## Separate Shared vs Feature Logic

Avoid:

```txt
mixed unrelated utilities everywhere
```

---

# Responsible Agent

```txt
Architecture Agent
```

---

# Priority 2 — Freeze Database Direction

## Goal

Prevent uncontrolled schema chaos.

---

# Immediate Tasks

## Finalize Core Enums

Examples:

- roles
- complaint status
- visitor status
- payment status

---

## Add Missing Indexes

Critical for:

- performance
- filtering
- analytics

---

## Add Audit Fields

Add:

```prisma
createdBy
updatedBy
```

---

## Add Soft Delete Strategy

Important for:

- finance
- residents
- complaints
- notices

---

# Important Rule

ONLY:

```txt
Database Agent
```

can modify Prisma schema.

---

# Priority 3 — Stabilize Authentication & RBAC

## Goal

Secure the entire application BEFORE scaling.

---

# Immediate Tasks

## Create Centralized Permission System

Avoid:

```ts
if(user.role === "ADMIN")
```

throughout the app.

---

## Build Permission Utilities

Examples:

```ts
hasPermission()
requireRole()
requireAuth()
```

---

## Protect All APIs

Validate:

- session
- role
- ownership

---

## Audit Dashboard Access

Ensure:

- unauthorized users cannot access protected routes

---

# Responsible Agent

```txt
Auth & Security Agent
```

---

# Priority 4 — Create Validation Layer

## Goal

Prevent inconsistent and unsafe data handling.

---

# Immediate Tasks

## Add zod Validation

Validate:

- request body
- params
- query values

---

## Standardize Validation Structure

Recommended:

```txt
/modules/*/validations/
```

---

## Align Frontend & Backend Validation

Prevent:

- inconsistent form rules

---

# Responsible Agent

```txt
Backend Agent
```

---

# Priority 5 — Build Service Layer

## Goal

Remove business logic from:

- route handlers
- frontend components

---

# Immediate Tasks

## Create Service Architecture

Recommended:

```txt
/services/
/repositories/
```

---

## Move Logic Out of Routes

Routes should only:

- validate
- call services
- return responses

---

## Centralize Transactions

Critical for:

- billing
- complaints
- approvals

---

# Responsible Agent

```txt
Backend Agent
```

---

# Priority 6 — Remove Mock/Demo Logic

## Goal

Prevent prototype logic from contaminating production architecture.

---

# Immediate Tasks

Audit every module for:

- hardcoded arrays
- fake dashboard metrics
- placeholder APIs
- temporary state

---

# Replace With

- real APIs
- validated workflows
- production state management

---

# Priority 7 — Frontend Standardization

## Goal

Create predictable and reusable UI architecture.

---

# Immediate Tasks

## Standardize Shared Components

Create reusable:

- buttons
- tables
- forms
- cards
- modals

---

## Add Missing States

Every async flow requires:

- loading
- empty
- error states

---

## Improve Mobile UX

Especially:

- visitor approvals
- notices
- complaints
- payments

---

# Responsible Agent

```txt
Frontend Agent
```

---

# Priority 8 — Core Workflow Completion

### Authentication

Security-critical.

---

### Resident Management

Core operational entity.

---

### Complaint System

Resident-critical workflow.

---

### Visitor Management

```txt
expand low-priority community features first
```

until:

---

# Common Mistakes To Avoid

## DO NOT

### Start Massive Feature Expansion Too Early

Stabilize first.

---

### Let AI Agents Freely Edit Everything

Use ownership boundaries.

---

### Keep Business Logic Inside Components

Use services.

---

### Spread Permission Logic Everywhere

Centralize authorization.

---

### Allow Schema Chaos

Freeze database ownership.

---

### Ignore Validation

# Final Recommendation

The repository already has:

```txt
very strong long-term potential
```

The biggest challenge now is NOT:

```txt
building more features
```

The biggest challenge is:

```txt
maintaining architectural discipline while scaling with AI agents
```

If the architecture is stabilized first, this repository can evolve into:

- a strong production system
- a scalable ERP platform
- a highly impressive portfolio project
- a robust AI-assisted development workflow example
